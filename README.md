# Flutter_msp

The `flutter_msp` library offers a convenient and efficient way to handle MultiWii Serial Protocol (MSP) communications in Flutter applications. Designed to simplify interactions between your Flutter app and drones or other MSP-compatible devices, `check_owl` enables developers to focus more on functionality and less on underlying protocol complexities.

## Getting Started

To use the `flutter_msp` library in your Flutter project, first ensure you have Flutter installed on your development machine. If you're new to Flutter, see the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) to get set up.

### Installation

Include `flutter_msp` in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_msp: ^0.2.0
```

Install it by running:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### Usage

Import the library in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_msp/flutter.msp.dart';
```

#### Example: Sending MSP Commands

To send an MSP command and receive a response, use the following approach:

```dart
int commandCode = 100; // Example command code
dynamic data = "some data"; // Data can be `String` or `int` based on your needs

// Encode the message
Uint8List encodedMessage = MSP.encodeMessageV1(commandCode, data);

// Send encodedMessage to the device
// Example: device.send(encodedMessage);

// To receive and decode message, use a similar approach
// Uint8List receivedMessage = device.receive();
// var decodedMessage = MSP.decodeMessageV1(receivedMessage);
```
